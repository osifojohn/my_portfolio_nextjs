        I am a dedicated, goal driven, and highly motivated individual. My goal
        is to succeed in any team I join. I have a passion for dealing with
        computers and figuring things out. My problem solving ability will allow
        me to excel in any field of computer science and I am confident in my
        skills. I understand we have challenges in life and that is what drives
        me to push through them, my love of beating challenges and working with
        people to beat a common enemy makes me who I am.
